# tic-tac-toe
This is a simple implementation of the classic game, Tic Tac Toe. The game is structured for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid with 'X' or 'O'. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If the grid is filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
